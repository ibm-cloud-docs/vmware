# VMware
{: #vmware}

VMware provides an industry-leading virtualization platform that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and networking resources to create multiple virtual servers on a single physical server. Multiple physical servers can be clustered together to create a customerâ€™s own private cloud.

IBM Cloud provides the unique capability for customers to provision dedicated bare metal servers upon which they can deploy their own VMware based private cloud. For example, you can enable the creation of a hybrid cloud where on-premises VMware based servers, tooling, and processes can extend into the public cloud. For more information about VMware capabilities, see [here](/docs/vmware?topic=vmware-vmware-sddc-on-ibm-cloud).
