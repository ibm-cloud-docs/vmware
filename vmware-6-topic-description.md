# About VMware and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #about-vmware}

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} provides the unique capability for you to provision dedicated {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} upon which you can deploy your own VMware based private cloud. For example, you can create a hybrid cloud where on-premises VMware-based servers, tools, and processes can be extended into the public cloud.
{: shortdesc}

vSphere workloads and catalogs can be provisioned onto VMware vSphere environments within {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers without modification to VMware VMs or guests. The use of a common vSphere hypervisor and management or orchestration platform makes these deployments possible. vSphere implementations also enable the use of other components of the VMware vCloud Suite â€“ vSphere, vRealize, vSAN, Site Recovery Manager (SRM), and NSX.

The core objective of VMware and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is to assist vSphere administrators to deploy VMware vSphere environments within an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure. VMware administrators can use bare metal instances and network, storage, and backup and recovery constructs in a self-service manner. These constructs can then be used to deploy fully functional vSphere implementations, which can be built to extend or replace on-premises vSphere implementations.
