# VMware SDDC on IBM Cloud

The VMware SDDC on {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} solution provides a configured VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) that is built to a standardized format and architecture. This solution provides a private cloud that can be quickly scaled up (or down) and allows existing VMware virtualized data center clients to extend or move their workloads into the IBM Cloud. This scaling allows companies to address such issues as rapid capacity expansion (or contraction), migration of workloads to the cloud, establishing cloud-based backup and disaster scenarios.  The ability to set up development, test, training, or lab capacity is also addressed. More servers can be added quickly to meet increased capacity of over 10,000 sized virtual guest servers per region.

This SDDC configuration includes a software-defined networking solution that is based on VMware NSX. The configuration provides unlimited networking flexibility in defining new VLANs, assigning IP addresses, and establishing network services such as load balancing, firewalls, and routers.

Shared storage is included based on VMware Virtual Storage Area Networking (VSAN) software defined storage. VSAN provides highly available, high performance, single tenant storage that grows automatically as more capacity nodes are added.

The VMware SDDC on IBM Cloud – Advanced reference architecture is the first partner architecture to be certified under the VMware Validated Design program.
