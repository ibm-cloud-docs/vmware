# VMware SDDC on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}
{: vmware-sddc}

The VMware SDDC on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} solution provides a configured VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) that is built to a standardized format and architecture. This solution provides a private cloud that can be quickly scaled up (or down) and allows existing VMware virtualized data center clients to extend or move their workloads into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. You can use this scaling to address such issues as rapid capacity expansion (or contraction), migration of workloads to the cloud, establishing cloud-based backup and disaster scenarios. You also can set up development, test, training, or lab capacity. You can add more servers quickly to meet the increased capacity of over 10,000 sized virtual guest servers per region.

This SDDC configuration includes a software-defined networking solution that is based on VMware NSX providing unlimited networking flexibility in defining new VLANs, assigning IP addresses, and establishing network services such as load balancing, firewalls, and routers.

Shared storage is included based on VMware Virtual Storage Area Networking (VSAN) software-defined storage. VSAN provides highly available, high performance, single tenant storage that grows automatically as more capacity nodes are added.

The VMware SDDC on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Advanced reference architecture is the first partner architecture to be certified under the VMware Validated Design program.
