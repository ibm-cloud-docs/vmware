# How is VMware vSphere 6 licensed?
{: #how-vsphere-licesened}

The licensing approach is tied to your deployment mechanism, there are two ways to deploy VMware 6:

1. When you deploy vSphere from the control portal, VMware Service Provider Program licensing (VSPP) is automatically enabled. On deployment, a default user 'slvmadmin' is added to the Host for vSphere administration and integration services into the control portal.
2. When you deploy vSphere manually, customers can BYOL/BYOM (bring your own license and media), which allows customers to apply their standard licenses to these hosts. **Note:** If you want to use your own VMWare licensing, it is recommended that you order the server with a free OS like CentOS or as NO OS and then install the VMWare OS by way of IPMI [Virtual ISO](/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-mounting-an-iso-on-a-bare-metal-server)
