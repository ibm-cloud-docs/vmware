# Can I deploy VMware components directly from the IBM Cloud portal?
{: #deploy-vmware-components}

Yes, you have two options:

1. Select and deploy the ESX hypervisor automatically with a monthly bare metal system (Figure 2). You can also deploy vCenter management automatically with a virtual machine or bare metal system (Windows only).
2. Deploy a bare metal host with a free-operating system, such as CentOS, and subsequently install ESX manually by using Remote Console and virtual media access of the host. You can then install vCenter Server manually or deploy the VMware vCenter Server Appliance that operates on Linux.
