# Setting up Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) for VMware environments with QuantaStor
{: #set-up-brocade}

You can configure a Brocade vRouter (Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) appliance [high availability (HA) configuration] within a VMware environment that is using QuantaStor. Use the following information with the [Advanced Single-Site VMware Reference Architecture](/docs/virtualization?topic=virtualization-advanced-single-site-vmware-reference-architecture) to set up one of these storage options in your VMware environment.
{: shortdesc}

The Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) gateway serves as a gateway and router for your environment and contains zones that consist of subnets. Firewall rules are set in place between zones so they can communicate with each other. For those zones that do not need to communicate with other zones, no firewall rule is needed as all packets are dropped.

In the example configuration, five zones are created in the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta):

* SLSERVICE – {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} services
* VMACCESS – Virtual machines(VMs) on the capacity cluster
* MGMT – Management and capacity clusters and management VMs
* STORAGE – Storage servers
* OUTSIDE – Public internet access

Figure 1 describes the communication between each zone. **Note:** Your environment might be different and might require different zones and firewall rules.

## Configuring Brocade vRouter (Vyatta)
{: #configure-brocade}

To configure the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta), follow these steps:

1. SSH into the appliance by using the root password that is found on the Device Details screen.
2. Type 'Configure' to enter the configuration mode and follow the steps in the subsequent sections.

### Setting up interfaces

You configure the bond interfaces on both Brocade vRouters (Vyatta) to be linked to the subnets in the environment. You need to replace the VLANs (1101, 1102, and 1103) with the corresponding VLANs in your environment. **Note:** Instructions that are made with '<>' must be replaced with your environment’s details (with the '<>' removed).

Use the following commands to configure the bond interfaces on the Brocade vRouters (Vyatta). You must be in `configure` mode.

### Configuring SNAT for external access

You configure SNAT such that management VMs and VMs on the capacity cluster can access the internet. From this step forward, configuration needs to be done on only one Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) since syncing the setup occurs later.

Use the following commands in `configure` mode:

    set nat source rule 10
    set nat source rule 10 source address ##.###.###.###/## (Portable Private Subnet VLAN1101/Management VMs)
    set nat source rule 10 translation address ##.###.###.### (Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) bond1 IP)
    set nat source rule 10 outbound-interface bond1
    set nat source rule 20
    set nat source rule 20 source address ##.###.###.###/## (Portable Private Subnet VLAN1103/Virtual Machines)
    set nat source rule 20 translation address ##.###.###.### (Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) bond1 IP)
    set nat source rule 20 outbound-interface bond1
    commit
    save

### Configuring firewall groups

Next, configure the firewall groups that are associated with certain IP ranges.

Use the following commands in `configure` mode:

    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.128.0/19
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.0.86.0/24
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.176.0/24
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.64.0/19
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.96.0/19
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.192.0/20
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.160.0/20

    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.224.0/24
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.2.192.0/24
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.16.0/24
    set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.0.0.0/14
    set firewall group network-group 1101PRIMARY network ###.###.###.### (Primary Private Subnet 1101/Management)
    set firewall group network-group 1101MGMT network ###.###.###.### (Portable Private Subnet 1101/Management VMs)

### Configuring firewall name rules

Define the firewall rules for each direction of traffic.

Use the following commands in `configure` mode:

    set firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE
    set firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE default-action drop
    set firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE rule 10 action accept
    set firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE rule 10 protocol all

### Configuring zone bindings

Bind particular zones to interfaces on the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta).

Use the following commands in `configure` mode:

    set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE description “Internet Zone”
    set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE default-action drop
    set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE interface bond1
    set zone-policy zone SLSERVICE description “SoftLayer Services”
    set zone-policy zone SLSERVICE default-action drop
    set zone-policy zone SLSERVICE interface bond0
    set zone-policy zone MGMT description “Management VMs & ESX Host Access”
    set zone-policy zone MGMT default-action drop
    set zone-policy zone MGMT interface bond0.1101
    set zone-policy zone STORAGE description “Storage”
    set zone-policy zone STORAGE default-action drop
    set zone-policy zone STORAGE interface bond0.1102
    set zone-policy zone VMACCESS description “VM Access”
    set zone-policy zone VMACCESS default-action drop
    set zone-policy zone VMACCESS interface bond0.1103
    commit
    save

### Applying firewall rules to zones

Apply the firewall rules to the communication between zones.

Use the following commands in `configure` mode:

    set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE from MGMT firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE
    set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE from VMACCESS firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE
    set zone-policy zone VMACCESS from OUTSIDE firewall name OUTSIDE2INSIDE
    set zone-policy zone VMACCESS from SLSERVICE firewall name SLSERVICE2INSIDE

## Syncing with other Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) in the HA Pair
{: #sync-with-brocade}

Since you set up one of the Brocade vRouter’s (Vyatta) in the HA pair, you must sync the changes to the other gateway device.

Use the following commands in `configure` mode:

    set system config-sync remote-router <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) IP> password <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) PASSWORD>
    set system config-sync remote-router <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) IP> sync-map 'SYNC'
    set system config-sync remote-router <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) IP> username <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) USERNAME>
    set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 1 action 'include'
    set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 1 location 'nat'
    set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 2 action 'include'
    set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 2 location 'firewall'
    set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 3 action 'include'
    set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 3 location 'vpn'

    set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 10 location 'policy route'
    set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 11 action 'include'
    set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 11 location 'nat'

## Associating and routing VLANs
{: #associate-routing}

After the zones and firewall rules are set up on the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta), you must associate the VLANs to it and enable routing of the VLANs via the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta).

1. Log in to the IBM Cloud customer portal and click **Network, Gateway Appliance** and click the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta).
2. Select a VLAN and click **Associate**.
3. Repeat step 2 for each VLAN that you created for your environment. THe routing option must be enabled on your VLANs to be associated with the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta).
4. Locate the VLANs under **Associated VLANs** and check the box next to each one.
5. Click the **Bulk Actions** drop–down menu and select **Route**.
6. Click **OK** on the pop-up screen.

Your VLANs are now routed via the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta). If you notice that communication is hindered between two zones, bypass one or more of the particular VLANs in question and check your Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) settings.

You now have a working single-site VMware environment that is secured by a Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) within IBM Cloud.
