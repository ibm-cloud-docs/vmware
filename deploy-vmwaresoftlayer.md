# Using cookbooks for VMware deployments
{: #using-vmware-cookbooks}

VMware&reg; administrators can quickly realize cost-effective hybrid cloud characteristics by deploying into the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} enterprise-grade global cloud. vSphere workloads and catalogs can be provisioned onto VMware&reg; vSphere environments within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers without modifying VMware&reg; VMs or guests. These deployments are made possible by using a common vSphere hypervisor and management and orchestration platform. vSphere implementations can also use other components of the VMware&reg; vCloud Suite â€“ vCloud Automation Center, vCenter Operations Management Suite, vSAN, vCloud Network & Security, Site Recovery Manager, vCenter Orchestrator, and NSX.

The core objective of the VMware&reg; cookbook series is to assist vSphere administrators with the deployment of VMware&reg; vSphere environments within an IBM Cloud infrastructure. The cookbooks are not intended to train you how to administer vSphere. For more information about administering vSphere, see [VMware&reg; Education](https://www.broadcom.com/support/education/vmware){: external}.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} has several specific capabilities that give VMware&reg; administrators the flexibility to use bare metal servers and network, storage, and backup and recovery constructs in a self-service manner. You can then use these constructs to deploy fully functional vSphere implementations, which can be built to extend or replace on-premises vSphere implementations (VMware@Home).

The following guides are intended for experienced vSphere administrators. Some topics that are covered, consider that the reader has basic deployment skills to install and configure vSphere and vCenter.
{: note}

* [Build a Single Site VMware&reg; Environment](/docs/virtualization?topic=virtualization-advanced-single-site-vmware-reference-architecture) You, as the vSphere administrator, are guided through the steps of building your environment, including the use of either Endurance or Performance Block Storage or QuantaStor.
* [vSphere Migration](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.update_manager.doc/GUID-F7191592-048B-40C7-A610-CFEE6A790AB0.html){: external} Scenarios are presented to help you migrate workloads into VMware&reg; after your vSphere implementation is deployed in an IBM Cloud data center.
* [VMware&reg; backup](https://www.vmware.com/pdf/vi3_30_20_vm_backup.pdf){: external} describes alternative approaches to backing up, recovering, and archiving VMware-based workloads that are running in a VMware deployment.
* [VMware&reg; disaster recovery guide](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Site-Recovery-Manager/index.html){: external} Documentation for VMware&reg; Site Recovery Manager.
