To install the Agent, download and copy the `Agent-VMware-ESX-Server-6.71.<version-info>.tar.gz` package onto the target ESX Server by using the following command:

`wget -N http://downloads.service.softlayer.com/evault/archive/Agent-VMware-ESX-Server-6.71.2105.tar.gz`

**Note:** You must perform the following steps locally on the target ESX Server.

1. Extract the files from the package. To do so, use this command (in which “PACKAGENAME” might be “Agent-VMware-ESX-Server-6.71”):<br/>`tar xvfz PACKAGENAME.tar.gz`
2. Go to the directory where you extracted the package.
3. Run the installation script:<br />`# ./install.sh`<br/><br/>
   The installation script prompts you for configuration information such as web registration (address, port number, and authentication) and log file name{: note}

Enter the WebCC username for this server.

4. Enter the **EVault Backup username** for the WebCC username.
