# Getting started with VMware
{: #vmware-getting-started}

VMware for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Classic infrastructure provides an industry-leading virtualization platform that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and networking resources to create multiple {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachinesshort}} on a single physical server. Multiple physical servers can be clustered together to create a private cloud.

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} provides the unique capability for customers to provision dedicated {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} upon which they can deploy their own VMware based private cloud. For example, you can enable the creation of a hybrid cloud where on-premises VMware based servers, tooling, and processes can be extended into the public cloud.

| Get Started       |
|------------------|
| 1. Learn about the [VMware and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/vmware?topic=vmware-about-vmware#about-vmware) feature. |
| 2. Review the [licensing options](/docs/vmware?topic=vmware-license-options-vmware#license-options-vmware) and [storage options](/docs/vmware?topic=vmware-vmware-storage).|
| 3. To deploy a basic single-site VMware environment running in an IBM Cloud data center, see [Getting Started with VMware vSphere 6](/docs/vmware?topic=vmware-nsx-overview#nsx-overview). |

## Next Steps
{: #vmware-what-next}

After you have a basic environment configured, you can [manage licenses](/docs/vmware?topic=vmware-manage-vmware-licenses).

For more information about an advanced reference architecture that outlines a hybrid cloud configuration, see [VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) on IBM Cloud](/docs/vmware?topic=vmware-vmware-sddc-on-ibm-cloud).
